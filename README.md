# ClashRoyale

Usage rates of various cards/decks in Clash Royale are scraped from StatsRoyale.com. Each card is assigned a node that links its usage to other cards. These relations are detemined within each deck from the top 200 players on ladder. All this data is then processed to highlight changes in the meta. The goal is to determine which cards are paired well together, and how the attributes of each card in Clash Royale relate to one another.
